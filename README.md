The new edition of Biostatistics for Clinical and Public Health Research is an introductory workbook to provide not only a concise overview of key statistical concepts but also step-by-step guidance on how to apply these through a range of software packages, including R, SAS, and Stata.

Providing a comprehensive survey of essential topics – including probability, diagnostic testing, probability distributions, estimation, hypothesis testing, correlation, regression, and survival analysis – each chapter features a detailed summary of the topic at hand, followed by examples to show readers how to conduct analysis and interpret the results. Also including exercises and solutions, case studies, take-away points, and data sets (SAS, Stata, Excel and/or CSV formats), the new edition now includes a chapter on data literacy and data ethics.

Ideally suited to accompany either a course or as support for independent study, this book will be an invaluable tool for both students of biostatistics and clinical or public health practitioners.
